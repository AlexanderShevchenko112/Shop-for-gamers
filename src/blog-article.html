              The very first step in this checklist is to decide if you want a
              pair of gaming headphones or a pair of gaming headsets.
            </p>
            <p class="art-tpart">
              So what is the difference between gaming headphones and gaming
              headsets?
            </p>
            <p class="art-tpart">
              Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic Gaming
              headphones are regular headphones that are used traditionally for
              music enjoyment. However, they possess qualities that are awesome
              for gaming needs too. Audiophilic characteristics such as great
              micro-detail retrieval, accurate sound stage and immersive sound
              experience make them feasible to double up as a pair of gaming
              headphones.
            </p>
            <p class="art-tpart">
              However, most audiophile headphones do not come with a mic nor do
              they have any mic attachment slots. You will need to get an
              external mic like the Blue Yeti X for communication support.
            </p>
            <p class="art-tpart">
              A professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is Ninja,
              famous for streaming PUBG and Fortnight. He uses the Beyerdynamic
              DT 990 Pro with Audio Technica AT2035 Cardioid Condenser
              Microphone while streaming his games.
            </p>
            <p class="art-tpart">
              There are several benefits and drawbacks to using a gaming
              headphones setup for gaming.
            </p>
            <p class="art-tpart">
              Benefits of Gaming Headphones Higher upsides for audio and mic
              quality
            </p>
            <p class="art-tpart">
              As you have a wider product selection for both the headphones and
              mic itself, you are able to assemble your gaming setup with the
              latest mic and headphones. There is potential for better overall
              audio and microphone quality.
